# Medical-Store-Management-System
Developed a comprehensive Medical Shop Management System desktop application aimed at streamlining and automating the management of pharmacy operations. This project was created using C#, ADO.NET, .NET Framework, Windows Forms, MS SQL Server, and Visual Studio 2022, demonstrating proficiency in desktop application development and database management.

The application includes a secure login system that differentiates user roles, providing distinct interfaces and functionalities for administrators and pharmacists. The Administrator module features a user-friendly dashboard, allowing administrators to add, view, and manage users efficiently. Administrators can also update their own profiles and perform role-based access management to control and oversee other users within the system. The Pharmacist module is designed to assist with day-to-day pharmacy operations. It includes functions for adding, viewing, and modifying medicine inventory, conducting medicine validity checks to flag expired items, and providing a sales interface for processing transactions. Pharmacists can also manage customer profiles, ensuring accurate record-keeping for all clients.

The application is integrated with MS SQL Server, which enables efficient data storage and retrieval for user information, medicine inventory, and transaction records. This integration ensures data integrity, security, and scalability for pharmacy operations. Designed using Windows Forms, the system offers a responsive and intuitive user interface, which enhances user experience and simplifies navigation for both administrators and pharmacists.

This project was built and thoroughly tested in Visual Studio 2022, ensuring compatibility with modern Windows systems and providing a smooth deployment process. This application showcases strong skills in software development, database management, and user interface design, highlighting the ability to create practical, secure, and efficient software solutions for business operations.
